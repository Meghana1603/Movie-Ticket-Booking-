<h1>ABSTRACT OF PROJECT:</h1>
         This mini project in c is about movie ticket booking.In this it provides the details about booking a ticket.In this if the user is the admin he can be able to change the price of ticket(he need to enter the password to change,for this I used string campare function) ,view the reserved ticket.Else if the user can be able to book the ticket,he can also be able to cancel the ticket.For booking a ticket it takes the name of the user,phone number,asks the user to choose the seat number(this I had done using structures).If the seat has already been reserved by other person,it displays the seat is reserved and asks the user the choose other seat(I had given the seat numbers using calloc function) .To cancel the ticket the user need to enter the Id of the ticket which was given when he books the ticket.Thus this project provides the above details for booking a movie ticket.
